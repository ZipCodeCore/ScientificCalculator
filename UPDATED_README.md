Mark Brown Project Calculator

Below describes the functionality of the command line calculator as well as operations details.

The default state of the display when the program starts is "0". This default state can be returned to at any time by using "c" to clear. The calculator can be exited at anytime using "e".

From the default state, the calculator can be initialized by typing any number. Any other input will be regarded as an invalid input. Once it is initialized, calculations can be made.

To perform calculations, use conventional simple calculator process.
1. Type the number, press enter
2. Type the operator. For unary operations, the result will appear automatically.
3. For binary operations, type a second number and press enter. The result will appear automatically.
4. Repeat as necessary.

The following operations are supported:
1. Basic Algebra (using "+", "-", "*", "/")
2. Quick Functions (using "^2" for squaring, "^" for variable exponentiation, "1/" for inverse, "sqrt" for square root, and "neg" for negation)
3. Logarithmic Functions (using "log", "ln", "10^", "e^")
4. Basic Trigonometric Functions (using "sin", "cos" and "tan")

The following conventions are supported:
1. "Deg" and "Rad" for converting to degrees or radians, respectively
2. Error checks for invalid operations (such as divide-by-zero or tan(90 degrees)).
